## 简介

当我还是一个 90 年代的孩子时，我读了一篇文章，我想和大家分享，让它留在集体记忆中。这是关于探索，通过好奇心和发现事物的兴奋。这段文字提醒了我，并把我带回到我开始探索硬件和软件广阔前景的地方。所以它引发了美好的回忆。

为了解释一下你将要阅读的文本，我想解释一下维基百科的页面:[维基百科:黑客宣言](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_Manifesto)

> 《黑客的良心》(也称为《黑客宣言》)是一位计算机安全黑客于 1986 年 1 月 8 日写的一篇短文，他以导师(本名 Loyd Blankenship)为笔名(或化名),他属于第二代黑客组织“末日军团”
> 
> 它是在作者被捕后写的，首次发表在地下黑客 ezine [Phrack](http://www.phrack.org) 上，可以在许多网站上找到，也可以在 t 恤和电影中找到。
> 
> 该宣言被认为是黑客文化的基石，是全球黑客的指南，尤其是对该领域的新手。它是黑客行为的道德基础，并声称黑客行为有一个超越自私自利剥削或伤害他人的点，技术应该用来扩展我们的视野，并试图保持世界自由。

        Another one got caught today, it's all over the papers.  "Teenager
Arrested in Computer Crime Scandal", "Hacker Arrested after Bank Tampering"...
        Damn kids.  They're all alike.

        But did you, in your three-piece psychology and 1950's technobrain,
ever take a look behind the eyes of the hacker?  Did you ever wonder what
made him tick, what forces shaped him, what may have molded him?
        I am a hacker, enter my world...
        Mine is a world that begins with school... I'm smarter than most of
the other kids, this crap they teach us bores me...
        Damn underachiever.  They're all alike.

        I'm in junior high or high school.  I've listened to teachers explain
for the fifteenth time how to reduce a fraction.  I understand it.  "No, Ms.
Smith, I didn't show my work.  I did it in my head..."
        Damn kid.  Probably copied it.  They're all alike.

        I made a discovery today.  I found a computer.  Wait a second, this is
cool.  It does what I want it to.  If it makes a mistake, it's because I
screwed it up.  Not because it doesn't like me...
                Or feels threatened by me...
                Or thinks I'm a smart ass...
                Or doesn't like teaching and shouldn't be here...
        Damn kid.  All he does is play games.  They're all alike.

        And then it happened... a door opened to a world... rushing through
the phone line like heroin through an addict's veins, an electronic pulse is
sent out, a refuge from the day-to-day incompetencies is sought... a board is
found.
        "This is it... this is where I belong..."
        I know everyone here... even if I've never met them, never talked to
them, may never hear from them again... I know you all...
        Damn kid.  Tying up the phone line again.  They're all alike...

        You bet your ass we're all alike... we've been spoon-fed baby food at
school when we hungered for steak... the bits of meat that you did let slip
through were pre-chewed and tasteless.  We've been dominated by sadists, or
ignored by the apathetic.  The few that had something to teach found us will-
ing pupils, but those few are like drops of water in the desert.

        This is our world now... the world of the electron and the switch, the
beauty of the baud.  We make use of a service already existing without paying
for what could be dirt-cheap if it wasn't run by profiteering gluttons, and
you call us criminals.  We explore... and you call us criminals.  We seek
after knowledge... and you call us criminals.  We exist without skin color,
without nationality, without religious bias... and you call us criminals.
You build atomic bombs, you wage wars, you murder, cheat, and lie to us
and try to make us believe it's for our own good, yet we're the criminals.

        Yes, I am a criminal.  My crime is that of curiosity.  My crime is
that of judging people by what they say and think, not what they look like.
My crime is that of outsmarting you, something that you will never forgive me
for.

        I am a hacker, and this is my manifesto.  You may stop this individual,
but you can't stop us all... after all, we're all alike.
