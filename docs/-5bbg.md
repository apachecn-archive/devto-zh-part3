What should I do if I fail to study in the UK? Contact q1252839746\. This may be the situation encountered by most alumni associations, especially those who are studying in graduate school in the UK. If they still fail the course, it may actually affect the whole life. What should they do in this situation?

The credits earned determine the final certificate.

Generally speaking, a master's degree in Britain only takes one year, so in fact, there is no saying that a master's degree in Britain should be dismissed, and there is no saying that a master's degree should be rebuilt.

Students get their own grades at the end of the school year. Generally, if they fail one or two courses, they will have the opportunity to apply for a re-examination. The credits they get finally determine the final certificate.

Generally, 180 credits (including 60 credits for graduation thesis) are awarded to master degree in the UK; 20 credits awarded to postgraduate diploma; 60 credits awarded to postgraduate certificates.

Therefore, if the first master's degree is not successfully obtained, you can apply for a second master's degree and re-enroll. This does not belong to the category of transfer, but re-apply for a new course. Of course, the failure of the first course will also affect the application for the second master's degree. It is recommended to apply for related majors.

Some schools do not support make-up or retaking.

Some majors like Edinburgh University can't make up their graduation thesis.

For graduate students, the average score must reach 50%, and the total credits of the subjects satisfying 50% must be more than 80 points, and the graduation thesis score must not be less than 50%.

If the paper fails, then I'm sorry, you won't get a master's degree, because it is expressly stipulated that "not allowed to re-sit a paper" (you can't "make-up" the paper).

However, there are special circumstances, such as the death of relatives and friends, which lead to the failure of the paper. Maybe you can consult the college and submit the paper again, but the chance is still slim.

Diploma generally refers to the certificate of completion, and Degree is the degree certificate. The average score of Degree with Distinction is generally 70%, and usually the examiner is not really impartial. Within 2%, there is room for negotiation. For example, 68%-69.99% can get distinction, 48%-49.99% can get Master's degree, and 38%-39.99% can also be counted as you pass and get the certificate of completion.

Some schools can be retaken or retaken.

Some schools support make-up exams and retakes, but different schools have different rules and regulations, so it is very important to study Handbook carefully before school starts!

But what if you don't read your Handbook carefully and you can't find it at the end of the term? You can check the relevant make-up information in official website of the university.

Generally, you log in to the search website, and enter "reason Reassessment postgraduate" or "resist an exam"+"enter your school" in the search field. You can find out your school's measures for make-up exams.

If you fail the exam, or predict that you will fail the exam this time, you need to apply to the school for a make-up exam. When the school receives your application, it will contact your department to determine the make-up exam time and what form to take.

Pay attention to the deadline submitted for the make-up exam.

Each school's policy is different. In theory, some schools require 180 credits, and finally 160 credits, and they also issue degree certificates. But other schools really need to be serious.

Students with Tier4 visas are allowed to apply for visa extension in the UK if they need to take a make-up exam or retake it (including those who can't finish their studies within the specified time), and are not restricted by the rules of Academic Progress.

No matter whether the visa expires or not, students must apply for visa extension before the make-up exam. If they apply after the make-up exam, they will not be eligible for exemption. If students have already taken the make-up exam and then find that they need more time to stay, they must return home and reapply for a visa.

How to avoid failing the exam?

Notes are "lifesavers"

If you can't understand the language, ask your classmates to borrow it, but you must have your notes!

Don't memorize it.

The final exam is usually a 2-3-hour large-scale exam. Only by accurately understanding the questions and answering them rigorously can it be successful. Therefore, students should have a clear and orderly thinking ability for the whole subject.

Pay attention to answering skills

When you have collected the key contents of the examination review, even after the question bank (open question and answer), you need to review all these contents once, and then select several key topics to focus on.
