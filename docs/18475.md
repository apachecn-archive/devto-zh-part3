你有没有觉得自己做不完的事情？一天又一天，一周又一周过去了，你却从来没有去做你真正想专注的事情？那么这篇文章也许能帮到你！

今天，[主动解决方案](http://www.activesolution.se/)、[叶夫根尼·卢卡舍维奇](https://www.linkedin.com/in/evgenylukashevich)的一位优秀同事鼓励我与你们分享我的生产力系统。在回家的路上稍微思考了一下，我想:*为什么不呢？也许它会帮助一些人完成更多的事情，过上更加充实和快乐的生活。谁知道呢？我以前从未写过这方面的文章...这肯定会很有趣...*

## [](#a-long-time-ago-in-a-galaxy-far-far-away)很久以前，在一个很远很远的星系里

不久前，当我放弃了受保护的、自由的、不妥协的和无忧无虑的大学生生活，开始作为一名软件开发人员工作时，我很快意识到，突然之间，我没有时间做任何事情(除了工作以外的任何事情)。我会花几天时间工作，疲惫地回到家，做晚饭，吃晚饭，看点东西，上床睡觉，然后第二天重复。

经过几个星期的这种动态，与我以前的学生生活形成了鲜明的对比，在那里我几乎可以做任何我想做的事情，无论何时我想做，我对自己说:*“这不可能是生活的全部”。从那时起，我会努力寻找一种方法来完成更多的事情，从生活中获得更多。这就是我今天使用的*“系统”*的由来。在阅读了[大量的书籍](http://www.barbarianmeetscoding.com/reading/)并在这些年里慢慢改进之后，我会建立**一个生产力系统来设计一个值得过的生活**。*

[![The System Git Things Done](../Images/4448ba2233d9eff8cf0d204eac1867e1.png "The System Git Things Done")T2】](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--lkJHfYbH--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://www.barbarianmeetscoding.com/images/the-system.jpg)

## [](#the-system-gitthingsdone)系统，Git-Things-Done

### [](#the-basics)基础知识

该系统基于三大支柱:

*   相互支持的年、月、周、日目标
*   一套核心价值观、原则和人生目标
*   不断反思和持续改进

**每年、每月、每周和每天的目标给了我方向，确保我以最有价值的方式度过时间**(根据我的说法)。

我通过在不同领域设定 3 个目标来开始这一年，例如:我自己*、*生活*、*事业*、*财务*等等。然后，我将一年分成几个季度，并为每个季度设定主题，这是我在每个季度想要实现的目标的高层次视图。这些必须以某种方式支持并符合年度目标。每个月我都会为这个月设定 3 个目标，一个是我想改进的，一个是我应该停止做的。同样，这些目标应该支持季度和年度目标。每周我都会为一周设定 3 个目标，以此类推。当我达到白天水平时，我可能会根据情况使用类似番茄工作法的辅助技术。*

 *核心价值观、原则和人生目标帮助我做决定。当你思考过你想要成为什么样的人和如何表现时，做决定就容易多了。**人生目标也是长期的指导**。

最后，我经常反思(每天、每周、每月、每年)，并将改进融入到即将到来的目标中。这基本上就是我持续改进的**机制**。

**在实践**中，我通过用 [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) 编写的文本文件处理*这个系统*中的一切，并存储在一个 git 存储库中(这就是为什么我称它为 **GitThingsDone** 有时[搞定](http://gettingthingsdone.com/) + Git = Git-Things-Done :D)。我使用 vim 编辑它们:

[![The System Git Things Done and vim](../Images/38ac9a071ac15a1dd21192c6959f5a92.png "The System Git Things Done and vim")T2】](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--RHWnjiN2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://www.barbarianmeetscoding.com/images/gitthingsdone-in-vim-small.png)

这些年来，我尝试了许多不同的应用程序:像 evernote 这样的笔记应用程序，像 pivotal tracker 这样的 scrum/kanban 应用程序，to-do-list 应用程序，trello，但是我最终无可挽回地使用了这个工具，并感到沮丧。因此，最终，没有什么能给我提供一个好的旧文本文件的灵活性和易用性。

这是 GitThingsDone 中涉及的不同步骤的总结:

*   **思考你的价值观、原则和人生目标**
    *   经常复习
*   **每年**:
    *   年初:为每个领域和这一年设定 3 个目标。设定季度目标
    *   年末:回顾一年，庆祝，反思
*   **每月**:
    *   月初:回顾年度目标。为每月设定 3 个支持年度目标的目标。专注于改善一件事，停止做不必要的事。
    *   月末:回顾一个月，庆祝，反思
*   **每周**:
    *   本周开始:回顾每月目标。设定 3 个支持月目标的本周目标。专注于改善一件事，停止做不必要的事。
    *   周末:回顾一周，庆祝，反思
*   **每周(首页)**:
    *   一周的开始:除了上述计划外，提前一周做好准备。
*   **每日(首页)**:
    *   一天的开始:博客，火车
    *   一天的剩余时间:按计划完成目标。适应。灵活一点
*   **日常(工作)**:
    *   一天的开始:回顾每周目标。阅读邮件。回顾昨天的待办事项和剩余行动。为一天设定 3 个价值最高的目标。
    *   一天结束:回顾日，庆祝，反思和时间报告:)。

这就是这个系统的基础。在接下来的章节中，我会给你一些具体的例子和更多关于 *Git Things Done* 的细节。

### [](#yearly-overview)年度概览

当新的一年到来时，我会坐下来思考我想在这一年里实现什么。我思考我生活中的不同领域，并写下今年每个领域至少 3 个目标。这些目标将是我来年的指路明灯，我会在这一年中经常回顾它们。

例如，这些是我 2015 年的目标:

```
// I usually pick a theme for the year, month, week
// this year I didn't, I think I had some uncertainty as to what
// to choose since I had just moved to Stockholm and was starting a new job
# 2015 - The Year in which...

## Goals (set SMARTer goals)

### Myself
 - I want to finish things, get through with things more often
- I want to be more mindful of every moment, enjoy the moment,
  live in the moment
- I want to be more daring, outgoing this year, I want to get out there,
  be uncomfortable, do more things and talk to ppl

### Life
 - I want to spend more quality time with Malin. More travel,
  more and better time spent together
- I want to get the perfect body this year
- I want to get my driving license this year

### Career
 - I want to do an awesome job at Active Solution
- I want to release at least one new(updated) product with
  my company
- I want to write my first book
- I want to become an expert in front-end web development
- I want to become good at drawing, digital drawing and design
  with Photoshop

### Finance
 - I want to save 100K this year in addition to what I
  have saved thus far
 - save around 8K every month, which means 5K personal saving
 + 3K saving with Malin
- I want to have made 30K revenue from my side-projects
  (company, blog, etc) by the end of the year
- I want to have a better control/knowledge of where my money goes
 - remove all unnecessary monthly costs and spendings.
 - be more mindful and careful of how I spend my money
 - be smarter when paying things, take advantage of company offers,
      discounts, etc 
```

当一年结束时，我会坐下来，回顾这一年，思考我所取得的成就。我庆祝我所做的事情，从错误中吸取教训，对未来充满希望。这些是我 2014 年的回顾/反思:

```
# 2014 - The Year in Which I Started My Own Company

In summary:
 - Great job with life goals, better work life balance,
      great time with Malin and good job with health
 - Great job with career although not so awesome job in
      my personal career endeavors
 - funny I don't have any goal in relation to working at

          increased this year. I still feel however like I
          never have money, which sucks, I need to improve
          my grasp on my own finances and where the money is going  ## Goals
### Life

  more that 40 hours a week no matter what. Fuck overworking.
  Be more effective at work, do more in less time.

      have as many monthly subscriptions as I did before.
 - it doesn't feel like this was the main issue
          because I still struggle a little bit with money
 - I need to continue reviewing my monthly costs and spendings
 - Make better use of the stuff that the
          company offers me -> phone, training, etc 
```

#### [](#quarterly-goals)季度目标

在设定了年度目标并描绘了这一年将会是什么样子之后，我开始钻研并变得更加具体/实际的季度目标:

```
## Quarter By Quarter
* Q1: Angular.JS and buffing up my knowledge for Active Solution (Jan, Feb, Mars)
 * AngularJS
 * Web API
 * MVC
 * Certificates!
 * MSCD in web dev
 * front-end
* Q2
 * I: Knowledge
 * Certificates! MSCD
 * backend!
 - cloud
 - C#
 - Design and Art!!! Illustrator or Photoshop?
 * II: Focus a 100% on my company and develop a product (April, Maj, June)
* Q3: Write a book javascriptmancy -> portal (July, Aug, Sep)
* Q4: Learn Haskell and/or F# (Oct, Nov, Dec) 
```

然后，我将不同的月、周、日目标分成两个子类别，一个是*家庭和生活*(我不在工作时做的事情)，另一个是*工作*。

### [](#home-and-life)家与生活

#### [](#monthly-overview)月度概览

当我开始新的一个月时，我会回顾过去的一个月，反思并为下个月设定 3 个新目标。我还选择了一个我想改进的项目和一些我应该停止做的事情。

这些是我六月份的*家庭和生活*月目标，例如:

```
# June 2015 *The month I took the 487 Certificate biatches!*

## Goals
- Must: Focus more on Malin
- Should: Take the Azure and web services certification
- Could: Write 4 blog posts this month
 - Improve: Your exercise, concentration and level of energy at the gym
- NotToDoList: Don't get frustrated or annoyed for stupid things, chill 
```

这是我上个月的回顾:

```
# May 2015  * The month I took yet another certification under my belt *

## Goals
 * Must: Take the backend certification
* Should: Write 4 blog posts this month
 * I wrote 8 blog posts this month WAAAAAT
* Could: Train every single fucking day and medidate in the mornings
 * I have trained at least 5 days every week and meditated (at night)

### 3 things that went well
- Awesome job with the certification
- AAAWESOME job with the blog, writing 1h every morning has brought awesome results
- AAAWESOME job training first thing in the morning
- AAAWESOME job waking up at 5.30 almost every day of the week  
- This month was freaking awesome in terms of results and getting shit done

### 3 things that did not go so well and should be improve
- Plan more things to do with Malin, focus more on Malin and less on my career/hobby of developing
- I feel like I have lost a little bit of contact with my family
  and friends. I need to call my family more often and
  restablish the contact with my friends
- Played videogames too long some days this month. It was a
  ton of fuuuuuun. But I think it is hearlthier if I can
  timebox it. Otherwise the time flies by and whole days are gone.
- Be more social at work. Go to AW!

### What am I going to do to improve?
- Have a monthly goal related to beautiful Malin
- Book one day to call home. Make it a routine
- Timebox playing videogames you biatch 
```

显然，在这篇评论中，我经常称自己和其他人为告密者。

#### [](#weekly-and-daily-overview)每周和每日概览

再往下一层，我为一周设定了 3 个目标，一个要改进，一个要停止做。目标应支持月度和年度目标。由于我在工作之外没有那么多时间，我发现如果我提前计划好整个星期，我会更有效率(我花了好几年才意识到这一点)。这消除了每天思考和重新评估的需要，我可以马上开始踢屁股。

本周目标如下所示:

```
# June 2015 *The month I took the 487 Certificate biatches!*

## Goals
- Must: Focus more on Malin
- Should: Take the Azure and web services certification
- Could: Write 4 blog posts this month
 - Improve: Your exercise, concentration and level of energy at the gym
- NotToDoList: Don't get frustrated or annoyed for stupid things, chill

## Week 23
### Weekly Goals
- Must: Focus more on Malin
- Should: Complete at least half of the certification book
- Could: Write at least 1 blog post this week
 - Improve: exercise, concentration and level of energy at the gym
- NoToDoList: catch yourself when you are getting angry and let it go

### Monday 1st

```

事情是这样的。我在 5:30 醒来(以前试过醒来，但对我不起作用，不可持续)，我吃早餐(维生素、咖啡和燕麦片)当我看一个 pluralsight 课程或 dev 讲座时，我总是在死亡循环中失去 15 分钟(twitter、facebook、linkedin、gmail、twitter、facebook、linkedin、gmail、tw.....)，马林醒来，我们有一个**棒极了的**早上好拥抱和亲吻，我在 6:00 到 7:00 之间开始一篇新文章或继续为我的博客写文章，去健身房，然后在上午 9:00 左右开始工作。我在 18:00 左右下班回家，没有固定的脚本，我适应每天的情况，并试图找到时间完成工作。我在 10:30 到 11:30 之间睡觉。有时我在入睡前冥想。

这是上周每周回顾的一个例子:

```
## Week 22
### Weekly Goals
* Must: Write 2 blog posts this week
 * javacriptmancy series
 * redesign the blog series
 * working on it :)
* Should: Redesign blog

### 3 things that went well
- good job with the blog
 - wrote one blog post and started another one
 - also worked on the redesign and it went pretty well
- great job with waking up early, training and meditating!

### 3 things that did not go so well
- the weekend was superrelaxing but I feeel like I spent
  too much time playing XD I need to learn how to stop xD I
  should train myself to play timeboxed and obey that time
  boxing. Playing is fun, but you time flies while you are
  playing. It is dangerous! You're life can pass you by playing xD
- I need to schedule a day to talk with my family. Mondays?

### What am I going to do to improve?
- schedule a day to talk with family and stick to it
- timebox playing and stick to it! 
```

我试着把每一天、每一周、每一个月都想象成一张白纸。如果我搞砸了，如果我没有达到我的期望或目标，这都没关系。每天我都有机会重新开始，大干一场。

### [](#work)工作

#### [](#yearly-goals)年度目标

由于*工作*是一个比*家庭和生活*更具体的领域，所以它有更具体的目标。我再次设定了 3 个与工作相关的具体目标(如果可能的话，与我的雇主达成一致，并讨论他们对我的期望)。

[![The System Git Things Done and vim at work](../Images/3fb823b62b731eb6ebf1eff799557704.png "The System Git Things Done and vim at work")T2】](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--1TF5mOWN--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://www.barbarianmeetscoding.com/images/gitthingsdone-vim-work.png)

以下是我 2015 年工作中的年度世界:

```
## Goals
1. 90% bel√§ggning // 90% allocation to projects as a consultant
2. MCSD before May
3. Write 32 blog posts this year (on JS :))
 - Stretch goal: Write a book on JavaScript for .NET developers before October
4. Become a ninja in front-end development -> Kompetensutveckling fokuserad i front-enden
 - Break down into topics
 - OOCSS
 - CSS frameworks
 - Bootstrap
 - Semantic UI

 - Foundation
 - JavaScript
 - Angular
 - Aurelia
 - React
 - Front-end DevOps
 - Browserify/Jetpack
 - Yo, Grunt, Gulp, Bower
 - UX
 - Design
 - etc 
```

它们与我的一些个人目标一致，这绝对是一件好事(曾经尝试过同时向两个不同的方向划船吗？).

#### [](#monthly-overview-and-weekly-overview)月总览和周总览

每月和每周的概述工作就像在家里一样。我挑选了 3 个目标，一个要改进，一个要停止做:

```
# Juni 2015 - *When we completed KMD project in an AAAWESOME way*
## Goals
- Must: Complete Azure/web services certificate
- Should: Do an awesome job with the last month in the KMD project
- Could: Do a great job with the handover to the Polish team

## Week 23
### Goals
- Must: Create a great component library
- Should: Help martin and jonas as best as I can
- Could: Study like a boss for the certification
 - Improve: fix vim plugins 
```

与我在家计划的方式不同，我在工作时不会提前一周计划。有太多变化的优先事项和事情超出了我的控制范围，以至于我无法很好地了解我每天要做什么。

#### [](#daily-overview)每日概述

每天当我到达办公室时，我至少花前 15 分钟计划一天的工作。我回顾我的邮件(不要太多，这样就不会浪费时间)，检查我积压的行动，我前一天没有完成的事情，然后我选择 3 件事情去做，在这个时间点给项目增加最大的价值。

```
### Thursday 4th

// picture of how I spend my time

 - Wrapup
 - Time report
 - Reflect
 - What went well today?
 - What didn't go so well?
 - What am I going to do to improve?
 - Did I help anyone? 
```

一天中，我可能会根据身边发生的事情改变优先顺序，我可能会记下可能的改进，我未来想做的事情，我应该改进和学习的事情。

在一天结束的时候，我试着抽时间做一点反思。例如:

```
- Wrapup
 - Time report
 - Reflect
 - What went well today?
 - good job in estimation meetings, bringing up ideas, approaches, questions, etc
 - good job setting the foundation for the component library
 - What didn't go so well?
 - little bit slow with the component library
 - What am I going to do to improve?
 - continue contributing and speaking up
 - focus on the most important things first, don't get stuck fixing small things of marginal importance
 - Did I help anyone? 
```

这些目标设定和记录在工作中也有很好的副作用，我可以在任何时间点展示我在给定公司每天、每周、每月、每年都在做什么。

### [](#help-to-make-decisions-life-purpose-values-and-principles)有助于做出决定、人生目标、价值观和原则

花一些时间来思考你是怎样的，你想怎样，你的人生目标是什么，你的价值观和原则是什么，这有助于你在发展中更加积极和有意识地参与，并在生活中做出决定。

这些是我的。您可能已经注意到，有些仍在开发中:

#### [](#purpose)目的

```
# Purpose/Meaning system
 - I want to make the world a better place (not so S.M.A.R.T.)
 - Start with the people near to me
 - Live in the present
 - Be mindful and reflective
 - Enjoy every minute activity/thing
 - and increase/amplify IMPACT through my career and being an entrepeneur
 - WHY?
 - Because it's a worthy way to find purpose in life
 - HOW?
 - Building useful things as a software developer/entrepeneur
 - Building beautiful/inspiring things as a software developer/entrepeneur
 - Teaching/inspiring others to create awesome things
 - By being kind to the people around me
 - By championing worthy causes in my everyday life: sustainability, feminism, healthy lifestyle, etc  ## Purpose/meaning in different areas
### Professional:
- I want to be the most-awesome/best developer in the universe
 - WHY?
 - So that I can build awesome things and teach/inspire other ppl
 - Because I love developing and I am good at it
 - HOW?
 - Improve myself in software development

### Family:
- I want to be loving, kind, helpful, supportive, present and inspiring to my close family

### Be a Champion of worthy causes:
- I want to be a champion to the worthy causes of this world 
```

#### [](#values-and-principles)价值观和原则

价值观不是很可操作的东西，所以我喜欢把重点放在原则上。我喜欢遵循三个核心原则。这些是:

```
- Principles:
 - Core
 - Be awesome
 - Be kind
 - Be a leader (help other people be awesome) 
```

他们是有抱负的，也是卑鄙的:

*   令人敬畏:无论何时你做一件事，都要全身心地投入。尽你所能做好工作。为你的工作和你做的任何事情感到自豪。以敬畏为目标，以增加一点点额外的东西来改变世界为目标，
*   善良:对人好，有同理心，关心他人，
*   做一个领导者:让其他人变得有能力，帮助其他人变得了不起。

然后我有一大堆我试图遵循的次级原则。我经常重读它们，努力将它们内化:

```
- Principles - All:
 - When I get sad, I stop being sad, and be awesome instead
 - Life is short. Live your dream and share your passion
 - Be kind to people, smile, be positive, spread joy around you.
      At the same time, realize that you don't have to please everyone
 - Anything is possible, you make your own reality, you are
      in control of your life. Don't ever feel like you don't have a choice
 - Sell yourself well, don't be too humble
 - Don't put energy into things you don't want more of
 - Make small projects of every endeavour. Define goals and deadlines.
      Remember Parkinson's laws, every task extends itself to complete
      the time you have allocated for it.
 - Enjoy life! It's a short trip! Don't take things
      too seriously! Loosen up!
 - Don't forget the 20/80% rule, 20% of the effort provides
      80% percent of the results
 - Be curious. Always find the why of things! Question everything
 - Always strive to improve things and yourself,
      don't shut up, express your opinions
 - Get outside of your comfort zone. Make it a habit!
 - Sharpen the saw. Practice smart. Practice Perfect.
      How you perform daily is a reflection of how you practice
 - Be diligent, have discipline, a little bit of work
      every day makes a huge difference in the long term
 - Believe in people. People are not out to get you,
      people are just like you with their own needs, wants and insecurities
 - See obstacles and change as opportunities. Before
      obstacles other people may just give up. You won't.
      You will not give up.
 - Life is short, build stuff that matters
 - Do something that scares you everyday. Challenge
      yourself. You learn/develop the most when you do this
 - Don't waste time feeling sorry for yourself. Take responsibility
      for your life
 - Don't give away your power. You are in control of your own emotions,
      you have a choice. No one can make you feel bad unless you let them
 - Don't waste energy on things you cannot control. Focus on
      what you do control
 - Don't shy away from change. Change means new opportunities
      and things to learn
 - Don't dwell on the past and wish things were different.
      Live for the present and plan for the future
 - Don't make the same mistakes over and over. Reflect and learn
      from your mistakes
 - Don't resent other people's success. Recognize real success
      comes with hard work
 - Don't give up after the first failure. Be persistent
      and determined. Have true grit
 - Don't feel the world owes you anything. You are not
      entitled to anything, it is up to you to go out and take it
 - Be a leader. Help and inspire other people to be better
 - Have your own opinions
 - Don't expect other people to agree with you. You are
      a salesman of your ideas
 - Don't be arrogant. Think about other people and other
      people's proposals beyond your prejudices and preconceptions
 - Think about the big picture! Don't get always captured in the detail
 - Acknowledge people.
 - new principles
 - It's easier to bleed than to sweat.
 - Build habits. Make harder/painful to have negative habits.
      Make easier/pleasureable good habits. Work on creating the
      path of least resistance to the things that you want to work
      on for real.
 - Die empty. Ask yourself, what do I want to do before I die,
      and do it. Ask yourself, if this was the last day I got to live,
      what would I do? Would I do anything differently?
 - Do the Work, no matter what, Do the work
 - Every obstacle is an opportunity. Every time that something
      bad happens to you, don't get angry, don't get scared,
      stop yourself, think, reflect and find the opportunity
      within the obstacle, find a way to grab that obstacle and
      turn it to your advantage
 - Train your willpower every day. When you feel a urge of
      something that is not really good for you, wait 10 minutes
      and see if it is really that important that you satisfy it.
 - People doesn't know what you know. Don't get offended if
      someone thinks you don't know something. People usually
      mind about themselves, not about you. You need to have a
      very strong branding or be freaking famous before ppl give
      a damn, and even then... xD So chill dude... and sell yourself
      cause no-one else is going to do it for you.

### [](#reflecting-and-continuous-improvement)反映和持续改进

每一个好的制度都需要一个改进的机制。我的方法是经常反思(每天、每周、每月、每年)，定期寻求反馈，保持谦逊，发现可以改进的地方并加以改进。

当我每天思考时，我会试着回答这些问题:

*   今天进展顺利吗？
*   今天有哪些事情做得不太好，可以改进？
*   我要做些什么来改善？
*   我今天帮了谁吗？我做了什么好事吗？

当我每周、每月、每年反思时，我会回顾我的目标。在每张纸上写下评论和笔记，我会试着回答这些问题:

*   3 件进展顺利并且应该继续做的事情？
*   3 件不太顺利且需要改进的事情？
*   我要做些什么来改善？

### [](#other-supporting-sources-and-techniques)其他支持来源和技术

我做了一些其他的事情来补充前面提到的技术:

*   对于较大的项目和我想单独关注的个别主题，我会使用附加注释。例如，我为我的博客准备了单独的笔记，我试图在我最喜欢的 IDES 编辑器中学习的快捷方式，工作中的项目回顾等等。
*   当我很难集中注意力时，使用番茄工作法。
*   我总是随身带着一本记事本，以便在我需要/想要的时候做笔记
*   用一种非常类似于 GTD 建议的方式来处理我的邮件和收到的东西
*   在上下班的路上，当我洗衣服或者洗碗的时候，听有声读物
*   沉思

#### [](#a-project-example-blogging-at-barbarian-meets-coding)一个项目示例:野蛮人博客与编码

当我处理更大的项目时，我会创建一个单独的降价文件，并写下一系列内容:

*   我为什么追求这个项目？
*   我期望从中获得什么？
*   它有时间限制吗？一个具体的目标？如果有，完成了会是什么样子？
*   目标、待办事项、步骤、想法、脚本

我通常从定义我为什么追求一个项目以及我期望从中获得什么开始。就博客而言:

```
# Why do I Blog?

*I blog first and foremost to share my passion and
enthusiasm for software development*.

I blog:
*  for myself in the first place, for FUN
*  because it helps me materialize my thoughts and
   reflect in a very deep way
*  to share my passion and enthusiasm for software development,
   contagiate others!
*  to spread the word about the awesomeness of developing software,
*  to share information about great libraries,
   frameworks, best-practices and great ideas,
*  to make the software developer community better,
*  to share my projects and ideas with others

## What do I want to get across when I write a blog post
 * Fun
* Value proposition, how will it improve your life 
```

我也写下目标、任务、想法

```

我还在我的 wiki 中写了[许多信息供以后参考。](http://www.barbarianmeetscoding.com/wiki/)

#### [](#using-the-pomodoro-technique)运用番茄工作法

我发现[番茄工作法是非常宝贵的](http://pomodorotechnique.com/),但是我会根据我所从事的项目类型以及现有团队的动态来使用它。

我使用一个我很久以前构建的[小型 knockout.js pomodoro 客户端](http://www.barbarianmeetscoding.com/iPomodoro/) (alpha 版本)。在我设定了每天的目标后，我把它们复制到番茄工作法客户端，评估它们，然后开始一个接一个地完成它们。

### [](#no-longterm-goals)没有长期目标？

你可能想知道为什么我没有任何长期目标来回答经典问题*你认为自己在 5 年后会怎样？*问题。嗯，老实说，我还没有想到这一点，但迄今为止，生活目标的想法似乎是一个很好的指针，关于我想在未来的地方。

## [](#concluding)总结性的

简而言之，那就是*【系统】***git thingsdone**。在过去的几年里，这是我生活中重要的一部分，它帮助我完成了更多的事情，成为了一个更好的人，从生活中获得了更多。

如果你想开始做类似的事情，但不知道从哪里开始，只需选择你当天的 3 大胜利，这 3 件事会给你的生活/工作增加最大价值，并在完成后让你开心。之后，增加一些周期性的反思时间，并在此基础上建立你自己的系统。

你有自己的生产力系统吗？你有什么技巧或想法想分享吗？非常欢迎反馈！*
