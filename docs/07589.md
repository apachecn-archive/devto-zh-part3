# gnu time(usr/bin/time)可以检查进程内存使用情况，不需要 vmstat 或 sar

时间命令有两种类型。

*   bash 内置时间命令
*   gnu 时间

gnu time 命令可以测量 cpu 使用率、平均内存使用率、最大内存使用率等。虽然默认的输出格式很难看到，但用户可以定义自己的格式，只选择必要的信息。

| F  | Number of major, or I/O-requiring, page faults that occurred while the process was running.  These are faults where the page has actually migrated out of primary memory.                                                                      |

| P  | Percentage of the CPU that this job got.  This is just user + system times divided by the total running time.  It also prints a percentage sign.                                                                                               | 
| R  | Number of minor, or recoverable, page faults.  These are pages that are not valid (so they fault) but which have not yet been claimed by other virtual pages.  Thus the data in the page is still valid but the system tables must be updated. | 
| S  | Total number of CPU-seconds used by the system on behalf of the process (in kernel mode), in seconds.                                                                                                                                          |

| Z  | System's page size, in bytes.  This is a per-system constant, but varies between systems.                                                                                                                                                      | 
| c  | Number of times the process was context-switched involuntarily (because the time slice expired).                                                                                                                                               |

(this table from manpage of  time) 
```

您可以在环境变量$ TIME 中注册格式，或者用-f 选项指定格式。

```
export TIME="time result\ncmd:%C\nreal %es\nuser %Us \nsys  %Ss \nmemory:%MKB \ncpu %P"

or

time -f "time result\ncmd:%C\nreal %es\nuser %Us \nsys  %Ss \nmemory:%MKB \ncpu %P" <command> 
```

执行结果(运行和检查`sleep`命令)

```
$ /usr/bin/time sleep 1
time result
cmd:sleep 1
real 1.00s
user 0.00s 
sys  0.00s 
memory:2128KB 
cpu 0% 
```
