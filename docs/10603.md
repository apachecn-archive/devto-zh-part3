# 在 Ubuntu 18.04 上安装 dotnet core 2.2 时出现 libicu60 问题

> 原文:[https://dev . to/ramx/libicu 60-issue-while-installing-dot net-core-22-ld4](https://dev.to/ramx/libicu60-issue-while-installing-dotnet-core-22-ld4)

我试图在我的 Ubuntu 18.04 上安装 dotnet core 2.2，在浏览了[文档](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/linux-package-manager/ubuntu18-04/sdk-current)后，我认为这可能很容易，但当我开始获得
时，我遇到了障碍

```
 # sudo apt-get install dotnet-sdk-2.2

Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have
requested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable
distribution that some required packages have not yet been created
or been moved out of Incoming.
The following information may help to resolve the situation:

The following packages have unmet dependencies:
 dotnet-sdk-2.2 : Depends: aspnetcore-runtime-2.2 (>= 2.2.3) but it is not going to be installed
                  Depends: dotnet-runtime-2.2 (>= 2.2.3) but it is not going to be installed
E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages. 
```

在尝试了所有其他方法后，我发现我必须安装`libicu60`

```
 sudo apt-get install libicu60
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree
Reading state information... Done
Package libicu60 is not available, but is referred to by another package.
This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or
is only available from another source

E: Package 'libicu60' has no installation candidate 
```

所以最后我必须手动下载并安装`libicu60`

```
wget http://mirrors.kernel.org/ubuntu/pool/main/i/icu/libicu60_60.2-3ubuntu3_amd64.deb

sudo dpkg -i libicu60_60.2-3ubuntu3_amd64.deb 
```

现在我可以成功安装它了

```
sudo apt-get update
