# 如果你刚被聘为初级工程师，要做的 10 件事

> 原文：<https://dev.to/vadiminnyc/10-things-to-do-if-you-were-just-hired-as-a-junior-engineer-enl>

在我从事软件工程的时候，我自己也是团队的新手，并且有机会指导加入我的团队的新手。这个建议主要是基于我希望我自己在观察开发人员在开始时犯的错误时所做的事情。TLDR；不仅仅是代码的问题。

### 1.成为一个零

在精彩的《天文学家地球生命指南》中，克里斯·哈德菲尔德介绍了一个人在某种情况下的行为会有三种结果的观点:

*   -1 它们使情况变得更糟
*   它们不会对情况产生积极或消极的影响
*   +1 他们改善了情况

When you enter a new environment, it can be your desire to be a +1 that actually does the opposite. Of course you want to be a +1, but I can't tell you how often I've seen new developers start out of the gate pointing out everything that is being done wrong, how we need to change our entire process and that what they learned in the past is the true path. This kind of behavior starts your relationship with your new teammates off on the wrong foot and turns you... into a -1\. You can make things better but first, understand how *this* team operates, ask great questions and keep your eyes and ears open. Being a zero at this stage will set you up to share those great ideas when you understand how all the pieces fit together.

### 2.了解产品

To borrow a truism, as a developer, you are not paid to write code. Code is the tool you use to build product. Understand what you're working on, why it's important and what is most important to the product at this stage of the company's life. Early on, getting features out the door as quickly as possible matters more than full test coverage. Later in the game quality, stability and performance are going to become more important. Where is the product right now?

浏览最终用户会遇到的所有场景并做笔记，看看你是否能从更有经验的开发人员或产品经理那里获得一些时间来解释每件事情的作用。写下可以改进的地方，以便以后提出建议。如果你加入了一个忙碌的团队，他们可能会感激你为你的第一个项目准备了一些想法，如果你还没有一个合适的计划的话。了解你公司的产品是如何工作的，不需要任何额外的技术经验，但会让你立即成为一名有价值的专家。

### 3.了解公司

How old is it, who founded it, why? Who are the customers? Who are the competitors? What is the company's business model? What are their values? How do they market and sell their services? How do they organize? Where do you fit in?
Having a clear understanding of the character of the company you're working in will help you realize how your work fits into the bigger picture and make sure your ideas help move it toward its goals.

### 4.留下痕迹

你有一个在公司工作的人没有的优势——第一次体验一切。您将不得不建立一个开发环境。如果文档还没有，创建一些文档，你可以通过向人们提问来拼凑这些文档。如果有说明，请遵照执行，并更新您遇到的任何差异或症结。记录下你希望现在拥有的一切不存在的东西。这个团队，以及未来加入这个团队的开发者，会感谢你的。

### 5.请求帮助

You will have to rely on the rest of the team to get up-to-speed on how things are done and getting to a certain level of technical ability. Most people are very helpful and understanding; you should still do your best to respect their time. A great way to do that is by persevering when you get stuck. It's tempting and easy to tap another developer on the shoulder to help you get through a tough bit of code, but don't do it yet. First, read the commit history, look for clues in the codebase, google around. If you're still stuck after trying at least two ways to solve the problem, ask for help as specifically as possible. Get in the habit of solving problems on your own while making the most of your team's expertise.

### 6.了解你的团队

Every group that has been working together for any period of time will have its own reasons for being as they are. Maybe you're coming into a team of two or three engineers and notice lack of project management processes or documentation, it's likely because this team has been busy shipping and their informal back-and-forth has been more efficient than a perfectly organized Kanban board at this stage. Pay attention to where people's strengths lie so that you know the right people to ask questions and where there are gaps you can help fill.

### 7.了解其他团队

While you are focused mainly on building the product, many people are affected by the work you are doing. Salespeople will need to sell those awesome features, customer success will need to support them and product people will need your help to know what tradeoffs exist with any given solution. Make it a point to get to know people throughout the company. Almost no one will turn down a coffee invitation and give you a chance to get to know them better. Knowing what's top-of-mind for people in different parts of the company will give you more ideas for ways to be helpful than you will know what to do with.

### 8.发现问题

If you've patiently done all of the above, you will have learned a lot about the product, the team and the rest of the company. Keep a list of all the problems you encounter and who is impacted by them. Things like - team has no documentation, dev setup is taking days, product managers don't include wireframes. Take some time to think about which problems, if solved, would produce the biggest impact.

### 9.解决问题

With your list in hand, you can start coming up with ideas for how to make things better. Some, you will be able to tackle on your own without too much additional input like putting together a repeatable dev environment setup and adding some documentation for the next hires. Early on, try to focus just on those problems that stand between you and flawless execution.

*错误*

“工程流程被打破，没有书面测试，没有代码审查，产品给我们的是声音字节而不是清晰的规格，首席执行官每五分钟就来一次，提出一些干扰我们工作的请求。我们必须修正一切，从以这种方式实现敏捷/Scrum 开始，并要求 100%的测试覆盖率。”

*右*

你:嘿，队长，我能得到一些建议吗？我真的不清楚基于这些规格我需要建造什么。团队领导:嗯...我也不知道产品是什么意思，我们走过去和他们谈谈吧。产品经理:哦，这就是我们要做的一切。
你:太好了，我根据我们的谈话做了笔记，并提出了这个规格，这是不是抓住了我们想要建立的东西？产品经理:是啊，太棒了。很有帮助。
你:好的，我会把这个添加到我们的产品文档中，如果>需求有变化，我们可以更新它，怎么样？产品经理:我们能克隆你吗？

产品人员可能比你更专业、更严谨，这只是一个例子。

### 10.保持增长

虽然你在工作中的首要任务应该是尽你所能为你的团队增加价值，但记住你的长期目标。这样，随着机会的出现，你可以在继续推动公司前进的同时，把方向转向那些会让你更亲近的人。确保你的经理知道你想要什么，这样他们可以帮助你进入下一步。整个堆栈可能会被拆分，这样你就可以更多地接触到后端开发，新的团队成员会加入，你将能够获得更多的领导经验，有人最终将不得不使用你一直想学习的工具来构建测试框架。在战略性地思考自己的成长和发展的同时，要有耐心并执行当前的职责。
