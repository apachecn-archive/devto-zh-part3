# 戴夫·斯诺登关于复杂适应系统的 DEV3L

> 原文：<https://dev.to/dev3l/dev3l-on-complex-adaptive-systems-by-dave-snowden-4e48>

Dave 试图帮助他的听众理解在与未订购、无法订购的系统进行交互时，如何以新的视角进行操作。软件开发是复杂适应系统的一个例子。优雅的隐喻有助于我们理解单词`complex` (cynefin)在提到一个系统时的常见误解。

他提供了一些关于如何导航到更理想的结果的想法:启用新的观点和思维，先发制人的能力，转移到邻近的可能性，无处不在的语言，为失败而设计+意外发现+未表达的需求，对厨师的欣赏，拖延和运气。

```
Complex Adaptive Systems 

New Ways of Thinking
- Thoughts on language

Methods elevated to the religion
- There are no recipes

Recipe book user versus Chef
- more chefs

We do not see, what we do not intend to see
Survivor of the luckiest - not fittest
Exaptation moments of radical repurposing
- first mover advantage by repurposing existing technology for novel purpose

Design for serendipity
Design for unarticulated needs

The nature of a complex system is that it always fails
- design for early failure
- only through early failure can you discover what is possible

Complexity - most misused word

Ordered / Chaotic / Complex
- ordered, not natural (linear causality)
- chaotic, without constraint
- complex, enabling constraints (no causality)

Dispositionality - science of inherent uncertainty
- try to project manage a children's party

Change ritual to engage in different cognitive activation pattern
= Radiologist missing Harambe (gorilla) in lung scans

No timesheet at IBM for 7 years : wow
Alcohol coffee cycle critical for software development
Socratic method, leads to hemlock

Small safe to fail experiments on coherent arguments/ideas
Analyze a complex system by interacting with it, not through modeling or analysis

Cynefin
- obvious
- complicated
- chaos
 - *starvation, pressure perspective* -- **innovation**
- complex

People respond to novelty
Last responsible moment

Art is critical to human invention
We learned to paint, before we learned to speak (as a species)
Art comes before language in human evolution

Distribute cognitive functions in complex systems
Shifting to an adjacent possible
