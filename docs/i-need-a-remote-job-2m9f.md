你好，

这是我的简历:

```
I am based in Nigeria. 

I have never worked in a software company after school. (Always being a     
freelance/self-taught developer)

I have 5 years experience in Java SE/EE 

I am good with HTML/PHP/JS/CSS... ANDROID/JAVAFX/SpringBoot .... 
NodeJS/VueJS (Introductory level)

I Don't mind forgetting what I know, just to get the offer of a Junior Entry         
Remote Developer and I can grow as i get familiar with the environment.

I know I am a good developer.

I work on freelancer.com already but i will prefer a stable remote offer

Most of my works are not online tho... they are lying on my laptop.

I will be glad if there's any one willing to risk hiring me

Cheers.
